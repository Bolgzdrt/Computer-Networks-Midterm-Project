# Mail Client

Assignment 1

Create a simple mail client that sends email to any recipient. Your client will need to establish a TCP connection with a mail server (e.g., a Google mail server), dialogue with the mail server using the SMTP protocol, send an email message to a recipient (e.g., your friend) via the mail server, and finally close the TCP connection with the mail server.
